<br>I would love to present a multiplayer Android+iOS game I am incredibly proud of and have been working on with 4 artists and 3 other developers. In the next few weeks I plan to add it to the Google Playstore, and I will put up a link here when I do
publish it.
<br><br><br> Until the link is up, I would like to show you something else I am extraordinarily proud of instead:
<br>
<h3>My passion</h3>

<br>Most of my hackathon projects revolve around the Internet of Things theme and connecting devices to the internet, or devices that utilize IoT (like the Microsoft Band). A few of my projects so far have been:
<ul>
    <li>An app to gain access to data like weather, news, directions, nearby places, stocks etc. without the use of the Internet (using text messages).</li>
    <li>Call a number and indicate symptoms to be provided with a list of doctors in your area that you can call, along with a text message with directions to the doctor you select and an option to connect your call to the doctor directly. Meant to be used
        in 3rd world countries where access to the internet isn't taken for granted.</li>
    <li>An Android app that connects to a Microsoft Band that sends and visualizes your current heartrate on a website, that people with a private link can view. It also sends a text to your emergency contacts, along with your current location when your heart
        rate falls below or rises above a certain level, that you can set on the app. This allows the family members and friends of a person who is at risk of heart diseases to keep track of and ensure the safety and health of the person at risk.</li>
</ul>

<br> Besides the hackathon projects, I also interned at Microsoft this summer, and gained a greater interest into Internet of Things due to Microsoft's <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-ca/cloud-platform/internet-of-things-azure-iot-suite">recent advances in the field of IoT</a>.
I will be returning to Microsoft for full-time, into the Azure IoT team (specifically the connected cars team which aims to connect cars to the internet).
<br><br>Thank you for considering me and I hope you have a great day!
